# Becoming an open source dweller

_June ??, 2024_

## Background

It was August 2022 and I was a freshman at that time. I was just getting into the world of tech. I had heard some of the buzzwords of it previously from various media sources like blogs, some YouTube videos and Twitter (I was using it like once or twice a week or so).

I came across the term "open source" by a video recommended on YouTube. After watching that video, I had a vague understanding of what the term means. I became curious about it. I did extensive Google search about the topic, read blogs, articles, etc. Then I looked at the Linux codebase on GitHub and saw it live in front of my eyes.
I saw and understood _(although a little bit)_ how the programs were written and how the systems were working together to make the system usable.

I continued that for quite a while and was searching for some 'good first issue' to contribute. I had opened some PRs in someones private repository previously and had a rough idea how to work on issues. Then in December 2022, I came across an [issue](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/issues/883) of updating images on one of the AsyncAPI's core repository. I asked if I could contribute to it and Lukasz said that I could. I took the responsibility of the issue and [successfully resolved it](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/pull/886). That was my first proper contribution to a large scale project.

Then I got invited to join their Slack and observed how things were being worked upon, how communication was taking place in a large organization of that scale, how people were collaborating with each other, brainstorming about an issue _(sometimes there would be massive discussion threads of it!)_, collaborating on an issue, helping each other out. I majorly observed and learned these things over the span of Jan, 2023 - Jun, 2023.

I genuinely liked these things and decided to contribute more
