# Becoming an open source dweller

_June ??, 2024_

## Background

It was August 2022 and I was a freshman at that time. I was just getting into the world of tech. I had heard some of the buzzwords of it previously from various social media sources like blogs, some YouTube videos and Twitter (I was using it like once or twice a week or so).

I came across the term "open source" by a video recommended on YouTube. After watching that video, I had a vague understanding of what the term means. I became curious about it. I did extensive Google search about the topic, read blogs, articles, etc. Then I looked at the Linux codebase on GitHub and saw it live in front of my eyes.
I saw and understood _(although a little bit)_ how the programs were written and how the systems were working together to make the system usable.

## Getting Started

I continued that for quite a while and was searching for some 'good first issue' to contribute. I had opened some PRs in someones private repository previously and had a rough idea how to work on issues. Then in December 2022, I came across an [issue](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/issues/883) of updating images on one of the AsyncAPI's core repository. I asked if I could contribute to it and Lukasz said that I could. I took the responsibility of the issue and [successfully resolved it](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/pull/886). That was my first proper contribution to a large scale project.

Then I got invited to join their Slack and observed how things were being worked upon, how communication was taking place in a large organization of that scale, how people were collaborating with each other, brainstorming about an issue _(sometimes there would be massive discussion threads of it!)_, collaborating on an issue, helping each other out. I majorly observed and learned these things over the span of Jan, 2023 - Jun, 2023.

## The Turning Point

I genuinely liked these things and decided to contribute more. I picked up [an issue](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/805) in Jul, 2023 which was above my then skill level and I consider it as my **turning point**. I worked diligently on it through [this PR](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/805). Many people came to help and collaborate and it was an awesome experience for sure!
The PR ran pretty long _(about 4 months)_. It was merged after rigorous testing and much trial and error. When it merged, I was very much happy and it was successful.

That issue alone gave me a massive confidence boost in my abilities to get things done. It led me to take up new and challenging issues that the older version of myself would give up on the first glance. It taught me to at least gave it a chance before self-rejecting it myself.

## Further Voyage

I kept contributing to the various repositories under AsyncAPI through reviewing code, documentations, nudging people for resources, helped a few beginners to get started with contributing to it. These all experiences over the past few years has made me a more avid contributor.

Lastly, a key thought in the open source ecosystem which I observed was:

**"Collaboration Over Competition"**

That's all folks.
