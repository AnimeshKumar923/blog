# Becoming an open source dweller

_June 21, 2025_

## Background

It was August 2022 and I was a freshman at that time. I was just getting into the world of software development. Had heard some of the buzzwords and jargons previously from various social media sources like blogs, some YouTube videos, Twitter (now X), and was a bit aware of what's going on in tech space.

One day came across the term "open source" when a video was recommended to me by YouTube. After watching that video, I had a vague understanding of what the term stood for.

It made me curious about it.

What followed next was an extensive Google search about the topic, reading blogs, articles, etc. Then peeking at the [Linux codebase on GitHub](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) and saw it live in front of my eyes.
Read and understood _(although a little bit)_ how the programs were written and how the different aspects of the software were working together to make the system usable.

## Getting Started

Thereafter, continued reading and discovering various repositories on GitHub for quite a while and was searching for some 'good first issue' to contribute. I had opened some PRs for practice and experience previously, and had a rough idea how to work on issues.

In December 2022, I came across an [issue](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/issues/883) of updating images on one of the AsyncAPI's core repository. Asked if I could contribute to it and [Lukasz](https://github.com/derberg/) gave me a green light. Took the responsibility of the issue and [successfully resolved it](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/pull/886).

That was my first proper contribution to a large scale project.

Then I got invited to join their Slack and observed:

- how things were being worked upon
- how communication was taking place in a large organization of that scale
- how people were collaborating with each other
- brainstorming about an issue _(sometimes there would be massive discussion threads of it!)_
- collaborating on an issue
- helping each other out

Majorly observed and learned these things over the time span of Jan, 2023 - Jun, 2023.

## The Turning Point

I genuinely liked these things and decided to contribute more. Picked up [an issue](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/805) in Jul, 2023 which was above my 'then' skill level and I consider it as my **turning point**.

Started worked diligently on it through [this PR](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/805).

Many people came to help and collaborate and it was an awesome experience for sure!
The PR ran pretty long _(about 4 months)_. It was merged after rigorous testing and much trial and error. When it merged, I was so happy. Never thought I could solve it but with collaboration even a newbie like me could solve the issue. It was such a great feeling to be honest.

That issue alone gave me a massive confidence boost in my abilities to get things done. It led me to take up new and challenging issues that the older version of myself would have given up on the first sight. Taught me to at least give things a chance before self-rejecting it myself.

## Further Voyage

After that, kept contributing to the various repositories under AsyncAPI through reviewing code, documentations, nudging people for resources, helping a few beginners to get started with contributing to the project. These all experiences over the past few years has made me a more avid contributor.

Some of my humble brags can be [found here](https://github.com/AnimeshKumar923/)

Lastly, a key thought in the open source ecosystem which I observed was:

**"Collaboration Over Competition"**

I keep this line at the back of my mind for everything in life nowadays.

That's all for this one folks. See you in the next one.

**_Happy Contributing!_**
